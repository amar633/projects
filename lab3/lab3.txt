Write a multithreaded C program that calculates various statistical values for a list of numbers. This program will be passed a 
series of numbers on the command and will then create three separate worker threads. (Another option to generate the input
numbers: you can get the total number from the user (n) and then generate n random numbers between [1-100] ). One thread 
will determine the average of the numbers, the second will determine the maximum value, and the third will determine the 
minimum value. For example, suppose your program is passed the integers:

90 81 78 95 79 72 85
The program will report
The average value is 82
The minimum value is 72
The maximum value is 95

The variables representing the average, minimum, and maximum values will be stored globally. The worker threads will set 
these values, and the parent thread will output the values once the workers have exited. (We could obviously expand this 
program by creating additional that determine other statistical values, such as median and standard deviation.)

Save your code as Lab3.c and submit (in Canvas) source code (.c) file with all the related files, including the exe file. Also, make 
sure to provide a picture from the output of your Lab 3.c execution. You can put all the files in a folder, zip the folder, and upload
it via Canvas.
